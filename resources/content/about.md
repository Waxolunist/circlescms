# About

My name is Christian Sterzl and I have been a software developer for more then ten years. I got into the world of software development during my academic studies in the field of communications engineering. Since then I have been steadily improving my skills of object oriented programming, web development and software architecture. In 2013, I obtained the Java Certification JEE5 Enterprise Architect or as Oracle calls it "the highest level of Java Certification one can achieve".

## Experience and Skills 

In addition to my experiences in the world of Java Development, I had the chance to work on projects using different technologies, frameworks and programming languages. Among which are .NET and C#, Python, PLSQL, Node.js or VBA Excel (sometimes the only way to go is the hard way). This list is not concluding, but I don't want to overwhelm my readers with arbitrary buzzwords. I am no idle person. On the contrary I am eager to learn new and more in-depth stuff in my field which prompts me to read a lot of articles and blogs.

## Projects and Open Source

In the [projects section](/cc/projects) I list most of my projects and name the technologies and frameworks I used to accomplish my tasks. I did some of these projects at work and some in my spare time. I share most of the work I do on my own on github as open source software. I benefit every day in my programmer's life from the availability of open source software. I therefore want to make my own contribution.

The most important open source projects I started are [validationconstraints](http://waxolunist.github.io/validationconstraints/), [bootstrap3-wysihtml5-bower](https://github.com/Waxolunist/bootstrap3-wysihtml5-bower) and [circlescms](https://github.com/Waxolunist/circlescms), which is the content management system this site runs on. I felt a need for developing circlescms due to the lack of extreme simple systems and out of curiosity for the node platform.  My contribution to other open source projects consists mainly on discussions, helping users, reporting bugs and sometimes providing patches.

# Home

I live in Switzerland in the canton Aargau with my wife Jasmin, my son Cedric and my dog Joy. Born and raised in Vienna, Austria, I moved to Zurich, Switzerland, in 2007.

We try to spend every spare minute together. I also love to indulge in my second passion - cooking. We spend a lot of our holidays in Austria but we also like to travel to more distant destinations like Florida.

Sometimes it's hard for my wife to get me off my laptop or my iPhone and I understand that it's not easy to be married with a nerd. She takes it with humour though - at least most of the time. That's one of the endless reasons why I love her every day more and more.
