If you don't already have it installed, add `ss-hogan` to your application's `package.json` file and then add this line to app.js:\n\n```javascript\nss.client.templateEngine.use(require('ss-hogan'));\n```\n\nRestart the server. From now on all templates will be pre-compiled and accessibale via the `ss.tmpl` object.\n\nNote: Hogan uses a small [client-side VM](https://raw.github.com/twitter/hogan.js/master/lib/template.js) which renders the pre-compiled templates. This file is included and automatically sent to the client.\n\n\n### Usage\n\nE.g. a template placed in\n\n    /client/templates/offers/latest.html\n\nCan be rendered in your browser with\n\n```javascript\n// assumes var ss = require('socketstream')\nvar html = ss.tmpl['offers-latest'].render({name: 'Special Offers'})\n```\n\n\n### Options\n\nWhen experimenting with Hogan, or converting an app from one template type to another, you may find it advantageous to use multiple template engines and confine use of Hogan to a sub-directory of `/client/templates`.\n\nDirectory names can be passed to the second argument as so:\n\n```javascript\nss.client.templateEngine.use(require('ss-hogan'), '/hogan-templates');\n```",
