# A responsive fluid css grid built with stylus

I am currently reading about [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/). The concept of having a modular css pleased me and received my interest. I wanted to test the concept hands-on asap.

Because I wanted to overwork the style of my website anyway, I started to modularize my stylus files.

I began with the underlying grid. I felt that [960.gs](http://960.gs/) didn't suit my needs anymore, so I searched for a new gridsystem backing up my design.

I wanted a 

* responsive, 
* fluid css grid 
* supporting [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). 

I found the [csswizardry-grids](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry-grids). The system is very easy to use and implement into an existing application. That obsoletes my 960-stylus port. I will share this port as a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/Waxolunist/5635811).

I will definitely use the new grid system in a lot of future projects, because it fits the SMACSS concept perfectly. The complete overworked design will soon be available on my site.
