I got into the world of software development during my academic studies in the field of communications engineering. Since then I steadily improved - and still do -  my skills of object oriented programming, web development and software architecture. In 2013 I achieved the Java Certification JEE5 Enterprise Architect or like Oracle calls it "the highest level of Java Certification one can achieve".</p><h2>Experience and Skills</h2><p>Besides my experiences in the world of Java Development I had the chance to work on projects using different technologies, frameworks and programming languages. Among these are .NET and C#, Python, PLSQL, Node.js or VBA Excel (sometimes the only way to go is the hard way). This list is not concluding, but I don't want to overwhelm my readers with arbitrary buzzwords. I am not a person which likes to rest instead I am hungry to learn new and more in-depth stuff in my field and so I am reading a lot.</p><h2>Projects and Open Source</h2><p>In the <a href="/projects">projects section</a> I list most of my projects and name the technologies and frameworks I used to accomplish my tasks. Some of these projects I did on work and some I did in my spare time. Most work I do on my own I share on github as open source software because I believe in the power of the community to achieve more with less when sharing and because I benefit every day in my programmers life from the availability of open source software.</p><p>The most important open source projects I started are <a href="http://waxolunist.github.io/validationconstraints/">validationconstraints</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Waxolunist/circlescms">circlescms</a>, the content management system this site runs on, because I was not satisfied with the available systems out there. My contribution to other open source projects consists mainly on discussions, helping users and reporting bugs.</p><h1>Home</h1><p>I live in Switzerland in the canton Aargau with my wife Jasmin, my son Cedric and my dog Joy. My origin lies in Vienna, Austria, and I lived there before I came 2007 to live in Zurich, Switzerland. </p><p>We try to enjoy every spare minute together and we like to get out of doors and indulging in my second passion - cooking. A lot of our holidays we spend in Austria but we also like to travel more far away destinations like Florida.</p><p>However, sometimes it's hard for my wife to get me off my laptop or my iPhone and I understand that it's not easy to be married with a nerd, but she takes it with humour - at least most of the time. That's one of the endless reasons why I love her every day more and more.</p></article></div></div><div class="footer-wrapper grid circles-overlap-width center"><footer class="grid__item one-whole"></footer></div></body></html>
