# About

My name is Christian Sterzl and I am a software developer since more then ten years. I got into the world of software development during my academic studies in the field of communications engineering. Since then I steadily improved - and still do -  my skills of object oriented programming, web development and software architecture. In 2013 I achieved the Java Certification JEE5 Enterprise Architect or like Oracle calls it "the highest level of Java Certification one can achieve".

## Experience and Skills 

Besides my experiences in the world of Java Development I had the chance to work on projects using different technologies, frameworks and programming languages. Among these are .NET and C#, Python, PLSQL, Node.js or VBA Excel (sometimes the only way to go is the hard way). This list is not concluding, but I don't want to overwhelm my readers with arbitrary buzzwords. I am not a person which likes to rest instead I am hungry to learn new and more in-depth stuff in my field and so I am reading a lot.

## Projects and Open Source

In the [projects section](/cc/projects) I list most of my projects and name the technologies and frameworks I used to accomplish my tasks. Some of these projects I did on work and some I did in my spare time. Most work I do on my own I share on github as open source software because I believe in the power of the community to achieve more with less when sharing and because I benefit every day in my programmers life from the availability of open source software.

The most important open source projects I started are [validationconstraints](http://waxolunist.github.io/validationconstraints/) and [circlescms](https://github.com/Waxolunist/circlescms), the content management system this site runs on, because I was not satisfied with the available systems out there. My contribution to other open source projects consists mainly on discussions, helping users and reporting bugs.

# Home

I live in Switzerland in the canton Aargau with my wife Jasmin, my son Cedric and my dog Joy. My origin lies in Vienna, Austria, and I lived there before I came 2007 to live in Zurich, Switzerland. 

We try to enjoy every spare minute together and we like to get out of doors and indulging in my second passion - cooking. A lot of our holidays we spend in Austria but we also like to travel more far away destinations like Florida.

However, sometimes it's hard for my wife to get me off my laptop or my iPhone and I understand that it's not easy to be married with a nerd, but she takes it with humour - at least most of the time. That's one of the endless reasons why I love her every day more and more.
